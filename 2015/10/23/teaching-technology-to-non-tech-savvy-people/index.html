<p>If you’re a relatively tech-savvy person, it’s likely that you are often asked to help people with their tech difficulties. You may or may not be a bona fide computer wizard. It doesn’t seem to matter: everyone in your family <span class="s1">or among your friends</span> turns to you when they have a computer problem. What to do?</p>
<p>I happen to like teaching, in a general sense. In the right mood, I find it enjoyable to get into people’s heads, figure out what they’re not understanding, and help turn on the light bulb. You may not feel the same way. That’s ok! Really, it’s not too hard. If you simply aren’t interested, I’m sure you can let people know. However, if you’d like some general pointers, here are a few tips on how to actually be helpful when you’re called on to help. Let’s say that Bob comes to you with a tech issue.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Be Patient</strong>.  It might sound cliche, but it’s true. It’s all too easy to get frustrated with somebody who <em>just doesn’t understand (grrr!)</em>. However, realize that Bob isn’t stupid and treat him respectfully. There’s some other reason that he’s not understanding, and you can help him figure out what that reason is. Now, it’s not your <em>absolute duty</em> to fix Bob’s problems. However, he’s probably a family member or a good buddy, so it’s a good idea to at least give him some sort of friendly advice.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Encourage Play</strong>.  One of your main goals should be to help Bob learn how to figure stuff out on his own. For certain things, it makes sense to write Bob a simple list of instructions. It might be something like “do <em>this, this, and then this</em> to turn the webcam on.” If that’s a recurring problem, then sure, go ahead and make that list for Bob. But what if he gets a new webcam that works differently? It’s usually much better to get to the heart of the problem: why can’t Bob figure it out on his own? I’ve found that the Bobs of the world tend to be afraid to play around with new technology, perhaps worried that they might break something. Conversely, I find that the best way to learn a new technology is to mess around with it. Thus, to really help Bob, try to make him understand that playing is ok. If that works, it also means that he won’t bother you as much in the future. Sometimes Bob still won’t be able to figure it out on his own, but you should have an easier time helping him when he is stuck.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use Language Well</strong>.  For all practical purposes, you and Bob are speaking different languages. Be specific, and be concise. There are bound to be terms and ideas that Bob doesn’t understand. I often find myself saying <em>too much</em>, especially about things that I think are cool, only to later realize that Bob got lost in my first sentence. Save yourself time - and avoid confusing Bob further - by making sure that he understands what you’re saying at each step along the way.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t make assumptions</strong>. This goes hand-in-hand with #3. Don’t assume that Bob knows how to download and install drivers, or that he even knows why he’d want to do that. Most importantly, <em>don’t assume Bob gets the big picture</em>. I often start by explaining very basic, seemingly unconnected things so that Bob has context for why I’m telling him to do certain things. Be a little careful, as this can come off sounding patronizing if you haven’t correctly gauged Bob’s level of understanding. In general, though, it’s better to err on the side of explaining thoroughly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The two main themes here are <em>be friendly</em> and <em>encourage self-reliance</em>. I’m certainly not the world’s best at this explaining thing, but I do like to give it my honest effort. That is to say, if you have any other tips, please share them in the comments section. And thank you!</p>
