        <p>It has been quite a while since I last wrote a blog post. I used to have a blog on <a href="https://babelthuap.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wordpress</a>, but hey – <em>I know code now</em>. And I have more interesting things to say! For instance, I’m pretty proud of this one-line memoized Fibonacci function:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> m = &#123;<span class="number">0</span>: <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">1</span>: <span class="number">1</span>&#125;, fib = n =&gt; m[n] ? m[n] : m[n] = fib(n - <span class="number">1</span>) + fib(n - <span class="number">2</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I deployed <a href="https://secure-earth-5739.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">my first Node.js app on Heroku</a> last night! (Source code <a href="https://github.com/babelthuap/markdown-to-html" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.) <em>After</em> I figured it out, it seemed easy and straightforward. However, it took a little time to get there. I’d like to share what worked for me.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs" target="_blank" rel="external">tutorial</a> on the Heroku site seems beginner-friendly, and it mostly is. There are a few key steps, however, without which your first deployment will not be easy. Here’s a quick summary of what you actually need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure your project directory is a git repo.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure your package.json correctly lists all your npm package dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a “start” script to your package.json. That is, supposing your server is called app.js, add</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="string">"scripts"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"start"</span>: <span class="string">"node app.js"</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>Specify, in your package.json, the engine you’re using. Supposing you want to use 5.0.0, you need</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="string">"engines"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"node"</span>: <span class="string">"5.0.0"</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>You need to be able to test your server locally and also have it work on Heroku. Set it to listen at</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">process.env.PORT || <span class="number">3000</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>Set up Heroku Toolbelt via <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up" target="_blank" rel="external">these instructions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, deploy your app with <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app" target="_blank" rel="external">these commands</a>. If all goes well, you should now have an app deployed to Heroku! To update it, you just need to commit your changes via git, then do</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git push heroku master</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This weekend, our <a href="https://codinghouse.co" target="_blank" rel="external">Coding House</a> cohort went to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/atthack?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="external">AT&amp;T Mobile App Hackathon</a>. In short, it was tons of fun! The atmosphere was both intense and friendly. It is wonderful to feed off of that energy.</p>
<p>The event started Friday night. We walked into a large room with tables, chairs, a stage, plenty of food and drinks, and several sponsor tables. We talked with the sponsors, who are eager to have you try out their technology, and went around introducing ourselves to the other hackers present. Honestly, I found it overwhelming at first, but soon found that most everybody is there to have a good time. We eventually split into groups. It’s possible to work with anyone there, but I ended up joining forces with my fellow students <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelRobertso6" target="_blank" rel="external">Sam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/anothertruant" target="_blank" rel="external">Adam</a>.</p>
<p>We brainstormed ideas for quite a while to begin. Eventually, we settled on making an app that uses the <a href="https://dev.projectoxford.ai/" target="_blank" rel="external">Project Oxford API</a> to detect faces in images, and then count the number of <em>distinct</em> faces in a sequence of images. We’re just 2 weeks into our Coding House cohort, so that seemed like a reasonable project to bite into.</p>
<p>Did we bite off more than we could chew? No! Sure, some parts were tricky, but we figured out the API fairly quickly (even though <a href="https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/54d85c1d5eefd00dc474a0ef/operations/54f0375749c3f70a50e79b82" target="_blank" rel="external">the documentation</a> was a little hard to understand). Then we just had to write a front-end web app to interface with the API. The greatest technical challenge was figuring out asynchronicity in JavaScript. I think I understand <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/javascript/making-promises-with-jquery-deferred.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Promises</a> now! The greater challenge, however, was figuring out how to work in a team. We used GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/babelthuap/facecounter" target="_blank" rel="external">here is our code</a>, by the way), which we’re really still learning how to use. More than anything else, though, I found that communication and intelligent delegation was vital. And it’s <em>hard</em>. I’m glad to have the chance to work on teamwork in the future. Next hackathon: December!</p>
<p>Our project? We actually did get our webpage working correctly and looking good within the 24 hours. I’m still a bit amazed.</p>

        <p><img src="https://babelthuap.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/confusing-md.jpg" alt="" title="What is this stuff?"></p>
<p>If you’re a relatively tech-savvy person, it’s likely that you are often asked to help people with their tech difficulties. You may or may not be a bona fide computer wizard. It doesn’t seem to matter: everyone in your family <span class="s1">or among your friends</span> turns to you when they have a computer problem. What to do?</p>
<p>I happen to like teaching, in a general sense. In the right mood, I find it enjoyable to get into people’s heads, figure out what they’re not understanding, and help turn on the light bulb. You may not feel the same way. That’s ok! Really, it’s not too hard. If you simply aren’t interested, I’m sure you can let people know. However, if you’d like some general pointers, here are a few tips on how to actually be helpful when you’re called on to help. Let’s say that Bob comes to you with a tech issue.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Be Patient</strong>.  It might sound cliche, but it’s true. It’s all too easy to get frustrated with somebody who <em>just doesn’t understand (grrr!)</em>. However, realize that Bob isn’t stupid and treat him respectfully. There’s some other reason that he’s not understanding, and you can help him figure out what that reason is. Now, it’s not your <em>absolute duty</em> to fix Bob’s problems. However, he’s probably a family member or a good buddy, so it’s a good idea to at least give him some sort of friendly advice.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Encourage Play</strong>.  One of your main goals should be to help Bob learn how to figure stuff out on his own. For certain things, it makes sense to write Bob a simple list of instructions. It might be something like “do <em>this, this, and then this</em> to turn the webcam on.” If that’s a recurring problem, then sure, go ahead and make that list for Bob. But what if he gets a new webcam that works differently? It’s usually much better to get to the heart of the problem: why can’t Bob figure it out on his own? I’ve found that the Bobs of the world tend to be afraid to play around with new technology, perhaps worried that they might break something. Conversely, I find that the best way to learn a new technology is to mess around with it. Thus, to really help Bob, try to make him understand that playing is ok. If that works, it also means that he won’t bother you as much in the future. Sometimes Bob still won’t be able to figure it out on his own, but you should have an easier time helping him when he is stuck.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use Language Well</strong>.  For all practical purposes, you and Bob are speaking different languages. Be specific, and be concise. There are bound to be terms and ideas that Bob doesn’t understand. I often find myself saying <em>too much</em>, especially about things that I think are cool, only to later realize that Bob got lost in my first sentence. Save yourself time - and avoid confusing Bob further - by making sure that he understands what you’re saying at each step along the way.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t make assumptions</strong>. This goes hand-in-hand with #3. Don’t assume that Bob knows how to download and install drivers, or that he even knows why he’d want to do that. Most importantly, <em>don’t assume Bob gets the big picture</em>. I often start by explaining very basic, seemingly unconnected things so that Bob has context for why I’m telling him to do certain things. Be a little careful, as this can come off sounding patronizing if you haven’t correctly gauged Bob’s level of understanding. In general, though, it’s better to err on the side of explaining thoroughly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The two main themes here are <em>be friendly</em> and <em>encourage self-reliance</em>. I’m certainly not the world’s best at this explaining thing, but I do like to give it my honest effort. That is to say, if you have any other tips, please share them in the comments section. And thank you!</p>
