I've been busy with the pre-work for Coding House.  So far, I've learned some JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and right now I'm working on AJAX.  It's exciting stuff!  I just finished the first project that's worth sharing, which I uploaded to [my site on GitHub pages](http://babelthuap.github.io/).  Check it out.
