title: Hello, World

My name is Nicholas. I am currently in the [Coding House](https://codinghouse.co/) bootcamp program. Here I begin a new life! I will use this blog to document my progress towards becoming a software developer, and to share any interesting thoughts I come across along the way. For instance, this is a one-line memoized Fibonacci function:

```javascript
let m = {0:1, 1:1}, fib = n => m[n] ? m[n] : m[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
```

Pretty nifty.

I used to have a blog on [Wordpress](https://babelthuap.wordpress.com/), but hey -- *I know code now*. These first few posts are taken directly from my old blog.
