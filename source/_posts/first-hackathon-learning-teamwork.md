This weekend, our [Coding House](https://codinghouse.co) cohort went to the [AT&amp;T Mobile App Hackathon](https://twitter.com/hashtag/atthack?src=hash). In short, it was tons of fun! The atmosphere was both intense and friendly. It is wonderful to feed off of that energy.

The event started Friday night. We walked into a large room with tables, chairs, a stage, plenty of food and drinks, and several sponsor tables. We talked with the sponsors, who are eager to have you try out their technology, and went around introducing ourselves to the other hackers present. Honestly, I found it overwhelming at first, but soon found that most everybody is there to have a good time. We eventually split into groups. It's possible to work with anyone there, but I ended up joining forces with my fellow students [Sam](https://twitter.com/SamuelRobertso6) and [Adam](https://twitter.com/anothertruant).

We brainstormed ideas for quite a while to begin. Eventually, we settled on making an app that uses the [Project Oxford API](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/) to detect faces in images, and then count the number of _distinct_ faces in a sequence of images. We're just 2 weeks into our Coding House cohort, so that seemed like a reasonable project to bite into.

Did we bite off more than we could chew? No! Sure, some parts were tricky, but we figured out the API fairly quickly (even though [the documentation](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/54d85c1d5eefd00dc474a0ef/operations/54f0375749c3f70a50e79b82) was a little hard to understand). Then we just had to write a front-end web app to interface with the API. The greatest technical challenge was figuring out asynchronicity in JavaScript. I think I understand [Promises](http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/javascript/making-promises-with-jquery-deferred.html) now! The greater challenge, however, was figuring out how to work in a team. We used GitHub ([here is our code](https://github.com/babelthuap/facecounter), by the way), which we're really still learning how to use. More than anything else, though, I found that communication and intelligent delegation was vital. And it's _hard_. I'm glad to have the chance to work on teamwork in the future. Next hackathon: December!

Our project? We actually did get our webpage working correctly and looking good within the 24 hours. I'm still a bit amazed.
